1. Define SPA and Its Benefits
SPA (Single Page Application) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the entire page.
 Benefits:
Faster navigation after initial load.
Reduced server load since most rendering is done on the client.
Better user experience with smooth transitions.
Ideal for dynamic data and interactions (e.g., Gmail, Twitter).

2. Define React and Identify Its Working
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially SPAs.
How React Works:
Uses components to break the UI into reusable pieces.
Implements a Virtual DOM to efficiently update only changed elements.
Enables reactive rendering â€” automatically updates the UI when data changes.

3. Differences Between SPA and MPA
Feature	SPA	MPA (Multi-Page Application)
Page Reload	No (dynamic updates)	Yes (full reload for each page)
Speed	Fast (after first load)	Slower
SEO Support	Limited (requires extra setup)	Better (natural HTML per page)
Development Focus	Frontend-heavy	Backend-heavy

4. Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application
Pros:
Fast user interactions
Smooth UX
Reduced bandwidth
Easier to convert to mobile apps
Cons:
